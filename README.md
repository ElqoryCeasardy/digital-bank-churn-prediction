ðŸ“Œ Digital Bank Customer Churn Prediction
ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in digital banking using machine learning.
Customer churn (when clients stop using the service) is a critical issue for banks, since acquiring new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones.

Through this project, I analyzed 10,000+ customer records to identify the main factors driving churn and built predictive models to support customer retention strategies.
